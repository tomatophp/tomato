### Social media and marketing

We maintain an active presence on various third-party platforms, which we use for marketing purposes. Examples of such platforms include Twitter, LinkedIn, and Google. Please note that we do not share your personal data with these platforms, as we highly value your privacy. Additionally, we do not use services like 'Custom Audiences' and 'Tailored Audiences', which require the sharing of customer relationship management (CRM) data.

### Anonymization

We may choose to anonymize certain personal data, which involves removing any identifying information so that the data can no longer be attributed to a specific individual. This anonymized data no longer qualifies as personal data and poses no privacy risks.

We have a legitimate interest in anonymizing data, as it enables us to conduct statistical research and improve our website without compromising your privacy.

## Third parties

As allowed by law and in accordance with our privacy statement, Eddy may engage third-party providers to deliver certain services. These third-party providers are authorized to use your personal data only for the purposes specified in our privacy statement. Eddy has taken all necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure that your personal data is only used by these third-party providers in accordance with our instructions and for the intended purposes.

Eddy collaborates with several third parties:

3. Eddy uses the following payment providers for processing payments made by paying customers. Please note that this only applies to paying customers and not to users on the free trial:
